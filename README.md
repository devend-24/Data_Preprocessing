# 🧹 Titanic Data Cleaning & Pre-Processing 🚢

## 🌟 Project Overview

Welcome to the **Titanic Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing** project! 🎉 This project is all about transforming the raw Titanic dataset into a clean, structured format. By focusing on data cleaning and pre-processing, we ensure that the dataset is ready for further analysis, visualization, or machine learning applications.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the historical **Titanic Dataset**, which provides detailed information on passengers, including demographics, ticket details, and their survival status.

- **Source**: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

## 🎯 Objectives

### 1. Data Loading 📥
   - Load the Titanic dataset using Pandas for initial inspection.

### 2. Data Cleaning 🧼
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Identify and impute or drop missing values to ensure dataset integrity.
   - **Data Correction**: Correct inconsistencies and errors in the data.
   - **Irrelevant Data Removal**: Remove any columns or rows that are not essential for analysis.

### 3. Data Pre-Processing 🛠️
   - **Feature Transformation**: Convert categorical features into numerical representations.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Create new features where necessary to enhance the dataset.
   - **Normalization/Standardization**: Scale numerical data to prepare it for modeling.

## 🛠️ Dependencies

- **Python 3.12.4** 🐍
- **Pandas** 🐼
- **NumPy** 🔢
- **Matplotlib** 🎨 (optional for visualization)
- **Seaborn** 🖼️ (optional for visualization)

## 🌟 Results

- A thoroughly cleaned and pre-processed Titanic dataset, free of inconsistencies and ready for further exploration or analysis.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

- Thanks to **Kaggle** for providing the Titanic dataset for public use.
- The data cleaning techniques were inspired by best practices in the data science community.
